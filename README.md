# Financial World Engine (FWE) / Japan Financial World Engine (JFWE)

FWE is a public, jurisdiction-neutral **synthetic financial world**
simulation substrate. It models a financial economy through layered
"spaces" (Corporate, Banking, Investors, Exchange, Real Estate,
Information, Policy, External) coordinated by a single world kernel,
and records every state-changing event in an **append-only ledger**
that is byte-deterministic across runs and reconstructable as a
causal graph.

This is **research software**. The public v1.x line ships only a
synthetic reference world; it is not calibrated to any real economy
or institution and contains no real prices, real holdings, or real
data feeds. The repository keeps its legacy directory name
`japan-financial-world/` for git history; renaming is a separate
migration.

---

## 1. What FWE is

FWE is an **audit-first** financial-world engine. Each layer is
designed so that:

- Every state-changing record is written to an **append-only
  ledger**, with stable world identifiers and explicit source /
  target citations.
- Every output is a **deterministic function of inputs**: same
  fixture → same records → same SHA-256 `living_world_digest`.
- Every actor decision is **explicit, traceable, and bounded**:
  a closed set of `reasoning_mode` values, a closed set of
  evidence reference ids, and explicit `unresolved_ref_count` /
  `boundary_flags` audit fields on every reasoning record.
- Every action follows a **four-property contract**: explicit
  inputs, explicit outputs, ledger record, no cross-space
  mutation.

The current concrete capabilities at v1.21.last:

- An **endogenous routine + heterogeneous attention chain** that
  produces auditable ledger traces from internal cycles —
  corporate quarterly reporting, **actor attention** building
  with a finite budget, and review routines — without external
  shocks.
- A **scenario-driver library** (v1.18) that lets a caller apply
  a synthetic stimulus to the world by emitting append-only
  context-shift records that cite the driver. The driver is the
  stimulus; nothing in the engine produces the *response*.
- A **monthly reference universe** (v1.20): 12 monthly periods
  × 11 generic sectors × 11 representative synthetic firm
  profiles × 4 investor archetypes × 3 bank archetypes × 51
  synthetic information arrivals from a jurisdiction-neutral
  release calendar.
- A **stress composition layer** (v1.21): one `StressProgramTemplate`
  + up to three `StressStep` entries → a thin
  `apply_stress_program(...)` orchestrator that walks the steps
  and reuses the v1.18.2 `apply_scenario_driver(...)` helper →
  a **read-only multiset projection** (`StressFieldReadout`)
  describing what was emitted on each **context surface**, in
  what direction, by which scenario family → a deterministic
  markdown summary suitable for an audit note.
- A **CLI export bundle** (v1.19.2 / v1.20.4) and a **static
  HTML analyst workbench** (v1.18.4 / v1.19.4 / v1.20.5) that
  loads the bundle locally — the browser never executes Python,
  never calls a backend, never writes files.

---

## 2. What FWE is not

FWE is **not**:

- A price-prediction engine. There is no price formation, no
  market microstructure, no order matching, no expected return,
  no target price.
- A forecasting model. There is no forecast path, no scenario
  probability, no expected response.
- A causal-proof engine. The ledger records *what was emitted*
  and *which records cite which sources*; it does not claim
  that any input *causes* any output in the real world.
- An interaction inference engine. Overlapping stresses are
  preserved as an ordered multiset on each context surface;
  the engine never auto-classifies them as
  `amplify` / `dampen` / `offset` / `coexist`.
- A composition reducer. There is no `aggregate_*` /
  `combined_*` / `net_*` / `dominant_*` / `composite_*`
  field anywhere in the v1.21 surface.
- An investment system. No trading, no order, no execution, no
  clearing, no settlement, no financing execution, no firm
  decision, no investor action, no bank approval logic, no
  investment advice.
- A real-data pipeline. No real prices, no real holdings, no
  real institutional identifiers, no licensed taxonomies, no
  paid feeds, no client communications.
- A Japan-calibrated model. v1.x is fully jurisdiction-neutral.
  Japan calibration begins in v2.x (public data) and v3.x
  (proprietary data). Any reference to BOJ / MUFG / GPIF /
  Toyota / TSE / TOPIX / Nikkei / JPX in the v1.x docs appears
  only to mark what is *prohibited* in v1.x or *deferred* to
  v2.x / v3.x.
- An LLM-driven system. No LLM execution at runtime; no LLM
  prose accepted as source-of-truth. The
  `reasoning_slot = "future_llm_compatible"` marker is an
  architectural commitment, not a runtime capability.

---

## 3. Why this exists

The public motivation is narrow and structural: most production
financial systems do not expose a single, append-only causal trace
that a reviewer who has never seen the codebase can read end-to-end.
FWE is an attempt to make the *engine* legible — to fix the
substrate before any layer that produces a market view sits on top
of it.

That goal implies four hard discipline rules:

1. **Audit-first, behavior-second.** Storage shape, citation
   shape, and ledger shape are designed before any actor
   behavior is written.
2. **Append-only ledger.** Pre-existing source-of-truth books
   (`PriceBook`, `ContractBook`, `ConstraintBook`,
   `OwnershipBook`, …) are never mutated by a later layer; new
   information is added as new records that cite the originals.
3. **Closed-set vocabularies.** Every label that influences a
   downstream record (sensitivity rung, severity, direction,
   surface, family) is drawn from an explicit frozenset
   enforced at construction time.
4. **Boundary as code.** Forbidden tokens (real institutions,
   real taxonomies, price-formation language, interaction-
   inference language) are scanned in tests; a regression that
   smuggles one in fails CI.

The audit value of v1.21 is in the **downstream citation trail**
— per-program / per-step plain-id citations + per-shift surface /
direction / family multisets + per-step resolution state +
warnings — not in any reduction or interpretive label.

## 4. Current milestone: v1.21.last

**v1.21.last Stress Composition Layer freeze (shipped, docs-only).**
Closes the v1.21 sequence as a **thin orchestrator + read-only
multiset readout** over the existing v1.18 / v1.20 chain.

Shipped sequence:

| Milestone     | Surface                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| v1.21.0       | Original design (superseded; preserved only in git history).   |
| v1.21.0a      | Scope correction. `StressInteractionRule` deferred to v1.22+ (or never); aggregate / composite / net / dominant fields removed; cardinality tightened (≤ 1 program / run, ≤ 3 steps / program, ≤ 60 added records). |
| v1.21.1       | `StressProgramTemplate` + `StressStep` storage in [`world/stress_programs.py`](japan-financial-world/world/stress_programs.py). +35 tests. |
| v1.21.2       | `apply_stress_program(...)` thin orchestrator in [`world/stress_applications.py`](japan-financial-world/world/stress_applications.py); walks `StressStep` entries by dense `step_index` order; reuses the v1.18.2 `apply_scenario_driver(...)` helper. +33 tests. |
| v1.21.3       | `StressFieldReadout` + `build_stress_field_readout(...)` + `render_stress_field_summary_markdown(...)` in [`world/stress_readout.py`](japan-financial-world/world/stress_readout.py). Read-only; no ledger emission. +33 tests. |
| **v1.21.last**| Docs-only freeze. Final pin section in [`docs/v1_21_stress_composition_layer.md`](japan-financial-world/docs/v1_21_stress_composition_layer.md); §130.8 in [`docs/world_model.md`](japan-financial-world/docs/world_model.md); refreshed roadmap row in [`docs/v1_20_monthly_scenario_reference_universe_summary.md`](japan-financial-world/docs/v1_20_monthly_scenario_reference_universe_summary.md); this README. |

  (byte-identical to v1.20.last)
- Source-of-truth book mutations: **0**

v1.21.last sits **alongside** the parallel-track freezes; none of
those is modified:

- **Runtime milestone — v1.9.last public prototype.** The runnable
  living reference world (3 firms × 2 investors × 2 banks × 3
  industries × 4 quarters), reconstructable from the append-only
  ledger.
- **UI prototype — v1.20.5 static workbench.** HTML / CSS / JS
  only, loaded under `file://`; renders the v1.20.4 bundle in 11
  tabs with no backend, no fetch / XHR, no file-system write.
- **Frozen loop — v1.16.last closed-loop freeze** + **v1.12.last
  endogenous attention loop freeze**. Time-crossing firm latent
  state, attention-conditioned mechanisms, finite **actor
  attention** budget with deterministic decay / crowding /
  saturation.
- **Settlement substrate — v1.13.last generic central-bank
  settlement infrastructure freeze.** Storage and labels only;
  no payment system, no real balances, no monetary-policy
  decisions.

## 6. Stress programs in v1.21

A v1.21 **stress program** is a small, ordered bundle of synthetic
stimuli applied to the v1.20 monthly reference universe. The
shape is intentionally narrow:

```
StressProgramTemplate
    stress_program_template_id
    program_label                  (closed-set vocabulary)
    program_purpose_label          (closed-set vocabulary)
    horizon_label                  (closed-set vocabulary)
    step_count                     ∈ {1, 2, 3}
    stress_step_ids                (ordered list, dense step_index)
    severity_label                 (closed-set vocabulary)
    affected_actor_scope_label     (closed-set vocabulary)
    reasoning_mode = "rule_based_fallback"
    reasoning_policy_id
    reasoning_slot = "future_llm_compatible"
    status, visibility, metadata

StressStep
    stress_step_id
    step_index                     (0..step_count-1, dense)
    scenario_driver_template_id    (cites a v1.18.1 template)
    severity_label                 (closed-set vocabulary)
    metadata
```

The orchestrator is **thin**:

```python
record = apply_stress_program(
    kernel=kernel,
    stress_program_template_id="stress_program_template:demo",
    issued_at=clock.now(),
)
# record.unresolved_step_count == 0  → all steps resolved
# record.unresolved_step_ids       == ()
# record.unresolved_reason_labels  == ()
# record.scenario_application_ids  → cites underlying v1.18.2 receipts
```

It walks `stress_step_ids` by dense `step_index` order, calls the
existing v1.18.2 `apply_scenario_driver(...)` helper once per step,
emits exactly **one** program-level
`StressProgramApplicationRecord`, and surfaces partial application
via a closed-set `unresolved_reason_labels` vocabulary
(`template_missing` / `unknown_failure`).

The readout is a **read-only multiset projection**:

```python
readout = build_stress_field_readout(kernel=kernel)
markdown = render_stress_field_summary_markdown(readout)
```

The readout describes — for each **context surface** touched by
the program — which `shift_direction_label` values were emitted,
in what scenario family, and which downstream records cite them.
It does **not** reduce the multiset to a single label; preserved
emission order is the audit value. The renderer emits 11 markdown
sections (9 pinned by the required-sections test as load-bearing).

What the readout does **not** do:

- It does not call `apply_stress_program(...)` or
  `apply_scenario_driver(...)` — it only reads what is already in
  the books.
- It does not emit a ledger record.
- It does not mutate any source-of-truth book.
- It does not auto-infer interaction labels. If an
  interaction-style annotation is ever introduced (no earlier
  than v1.22, possibly never), it must be `manual_annotation`-
  only — written by a human reviewer with their own analyst id
  and timestamp on the annotation record, citing explicit
  evidence from the multiset readout. It must never be inferred
  by a helper, a classifier, a closed-set rule table, an LLM, or
  any other automated layer.

For the full design discussion see
[`docs/v1_21_stress_composition_layer.md`](japan-financial-world/docs/v1_21_stress_composition_layer.md)
and §130 of
[`docs/world_model.md`](japan-financial-world/docs/world_model.md).

## 7. Public v1.x boundaries

Every public-FWE milestone preserves the same hard boundary. v1.21
re-pins the full list:

**No real-world output.**

- No price formation, no market price, no order, no execution,
  no clearing, no settlement, no financing execution.
- No forecast path, no expected return, no target price, no
  scenario probability weight, no magnitude.
- No firm decision, no investor action, no bank approval logic,
  no investment recommendation, no investment advice.

**No real-world input.**

- No real data ingestion, no public-data licenses are wired.
- No real institutional identifiers (BOJ / MUFG / GPIF / Toyota
  / TSE / TOPIX / Nikkei / JPX appear only as prohibited or
  deferred tokens in v1.x docs).
- No licensed taxonomy dependency (no bare GICS / MSCI / S&P /
  FactSet / Bloomberg / Refinitiv / TOPIX / Nikkei / JPX
  tokens in module text or test names; sector labels carry the
  `_like` suffix).
- No Japan calibration (deferred to v2.x / v3.x).

**No autonomous reasoning.**

- No LLM execution at runtime; no LLM prose accepted as
  source-of-truth.
- `reasoning_mode = "rule_based_fallback"` is binding across
  v1.18.x → v1.21.x; the `future_llm_compatible` slot is an
  architectural commitment, not a runtime capability.
- No interaction auto-inference (`amplify` / `dampen` /
  `offset` / `coexist` are forbidden as helper-emitted field
  names).
- No aggregate / combined / net / dominant / composite stress
  output.

**No source-of-truth book mutation.** Every pre-existing book
(`PriceBook`, `ContractBook`, `ConstraintBook`, `OwnershipBook`,
`InstitutionsBook`, `MarketEnvironmentBook`,
`FirmFinancialStateBook`, `InterbankLiquidityStateBook`,
`IndustryConditionBook`, `MarketConditionBook`,
`InvestorMarketIntentBook`, `FinancingPathBook`) is byte-identical
pre / post any v1.21 call.

**No backend in the UI.** The static workbench is HTML / CSS / JS
only, loaded under `file://`; the browser never executes Python,
never calls a backend, never fetches over XHR, never writes files.

For the public / restricted artifact rules see
[`docs/public_private_boundary.md`](japan-financial-world/docs/public_private_boundary.md).

## 8. How to run tests / export a local bundle / open the static UI

**Install** (from the repo root):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This brings in PyYAML 6.x (pinned `>=6,<7` in `pyproject.toml`),
pytest, and ruff. CI runs the same step.

**Run the full test suite** (from `japan-financial-world/`):

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Expected at v1.21.last: **`4865 passed`**.

**Run the v1.9.last living reference world** (from
`japan-financial-world/`):

```bash
# Compact operational trace:
python -m examples.reference_world.run_living_reference_world

# + deterministic Markdown ledger trace report:
python -m examples.reference_world.run_living_reference_world --markdown

# + reproducibility manifest (JSON, SHA-256 living_world_digest):
python -m examples.reference_world.run_living_reference_world \
    --manifest /tmp/fwe_living_world_manifest.json
```

Each mode is byte-identical across consecutive runs.

**Export a CLI bundle for the static UI** (from
`japan-financial-world/`):

```bash
# Quarterly default profile (4 periods):
python -m examples.reference_world.export_run_bundle \
    --profile quarterly_default \
    --out /tmp/fwe_quarterly_bundle.json

# Monthly reference profile (12 monthly periods, 51 information arrivals):
python -m examples.reference_world.export_run_bundle \
    --profile monthly_reference \
    --out /tmp/fwe_monthly_bundle.json

# Monthly scenario reference universe (12 monthly periods, scenario applied):
python -m examples.reference_world.export_run_bundle \
    --profile scenario_monthly_reference_universe \
    --regime constrained \
    --scenario credit_tightening_driver \
    --out /tmp/fwe_scenario_universe_bundle.json
```

**Open the static workbench:**

Open
[`japan-financial-world/examples/ui/fwe_workbench_mockup.html`](japan-financial-world/examples/ui/fwe_workbench_mockup.html)
directly in a browser (under `file://`). Use the bundle picker
to load a JSON exported above. The browser renders 11 tabs over
the bundle and **never** executes Python, calls a backend, or
writes files.

**Lint and compile checks:**

```bash
ruff check .
python -m compileall -q world spaces tests examples
```

Both should report clean at v1.21.last.

## 9. Roadmap

The v1.21 sequence is **complete and frozen**. The next steps are
candidates, not commitments; each requires a fresh design pin
before any code lands. Silent extension of v1.21 is forbidden.

**Deferred (or never).** `StressInteractionRule` and the
`amplify` / `dampen` / `offset` / `coexist` interaction-label
family are deferred to v1.22+ or never. If interaction-style
annotation is ever reconsidered, it must be
`manual_annotation`-only — never auto-inferred. See §130.7 of
[`docs/world_model.md`](japan-financial-world/docs/world_model.md).

## 10. Research direction

The longer arc this substrate is built for, stated honestly and
without overclaiming:

- **Make the engine legible before claiming any output is
  useful.** The v1.x line is deliberately useless as a market
  view. It is meant to be useful as a *foundation* — a layer on
  which higher layers can be added one at a time, each with the
  same audit discipline.
- **Replace narrative with citations.** A reviewer reading a
  v1.21 stress readout should be able to trace any line of the
  markdown summary back to the specific records on the specific
  context surfaces in the specific period that produced it,
  without reading the source code.
- **Preserve a hard boundary between substrate and behavior.**
  Behavior layers (price formation, allocation, lending
  decisions, policy reaction functions) are explicitly *not* in
  v1.x. If they are ever added, they will land as new
  milestones with their own design pins, their own boundary
  inventories, and their own forbidden-token lists; they will
  not retrofit existing v1.x records.
- **Keep public and private cleanly separated.** Public v1.x is
  jurisdiction-neutral and synthetic. Public v2.x will add only
  *public, licensed* Japanese data, with the license review
  done first. Private v3.x — proprietary calibration — would
  live in a private repository and would preserve every
  public-FWE boundary listed in §7.

What this substrate is *not* trying to be: a competitor to any
existing risk system, a market-view product, or an automated
trader. The current public release is a deliberately constrained
design exercise. Whether higher layers eventually justify a
practical claim is a question for later milestones, after the
substrate has been used in anger by readers other than the
author.
