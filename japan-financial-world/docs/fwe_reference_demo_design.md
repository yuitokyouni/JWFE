# FWE Reference Demo — Design

This document describes the **FWE Reference Demo**: a single, synthetic,
jurisdiction-neutral demo world that exercises every v0 + v1 record
type through the existing v1.6 reference loop and produces a complete
causal ledger trace.

The demo lives under `examples/reference_world/` (entry point + entity
catalog + expected-story narrative + runnable script). A test in
`tests/test_reference_demo.py` verifies that the script runs and the
expected ledger record types appear.

The demo is part of the **FWE Reference** product layer (see
[`product_architecture.md`](product_architecture.md)). It uses
synthetic entities only and makes no Japan calibration claim.

## Why a reference demo

After v1.7, FWE Core ships as a kernel + reference layer, and the
unit-and-integration tests verify every individual invariant. A new
reader who has *not* read the test suite still does not have a
single, runnable artifact that:

1. Builds a small but populated world (more than the minimal CLI
   smoke world; less than the kernel integration test).
2. Drives that world through the v1.6 reference loop.
3. Produces a ledger trace whose story can be read top-to-bottom
   without having to know the test fixtures.

The reference demo fills that gap. It is the answer to *"what does
FWE actually do?"* — runnable, narrated, synthetic, and small enough
to inspect by hand.

## What the demo represents

The demo represents a **single snapshot of one causal chain** in a
financial world:

- An external macro factor is observed.
- An information source emits a signal that references the
  observation.
- A valuer (e.g., a research desk) issues a valuation of one firm
  based on that signal.
- The valuation is compared to the latest market price; a
  `ValuationGap` is computed.
- An institutional authority (e.g., a reference central bank or
  regulator) records an institutional action that references the
  valuation and the gap.
- A follow-up signal is emitted that references the action.
- A `WorldEvent` is published on the event bus; on the next tick it
  is delivered to two target spaces (banking + investors), producing
  `event_delivered` ledger records.

The result is a ledger that contains every step of the chain and
preserves the cross-references (`related_ids`, `input_refs`,
`output_refs`, `parent_record_ids`, `evidence_refs`) that turn the
trace into a causal graph.

## What the demo does NOT represent

The demo is **not**:

- An economic prediction. No future price, return, default, or
  market outcome is forecast.
- A market impact model. The `WorldEvent` does not propagate into
  trades, quotes, or balance-sheet changes. v1 has no behavior that
  would do so; v2+ will.
- A trading simulation. No agent buys, sells, rebalances, or
  hedges. The portfolios in the demo are static.
- A Japan-calibrated model. Every entity name uses the
  `*_reference_*` naming convention and stays jurisdiction-neutral.
- A scenario or scenario branching. There is one demo run; the
  outcome is deterministic.
- A stress test. The demo does not stress balance sheets, capital
  ratios, liquidity, or constraints. It records one institutional
  action and walks away.
- An information-dynamics model. Signals are emitted, but no
  rumor propagation, narrative aggregation, or credibility decay
  happens.

The demo's value is in **causal traceability** — proving that v1's
record types, books, and orchestrator can be wired into a single
end-to-end audit trail. It is not a prediction tool of any kind.

## Demo composition

The demo populates a kernel with:

| Category               | Count | IDs                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Firms                  | 5     | `firm:reference_manufacturer_a`, `firm:reference_manufacturer_b`, `firm:reference_retailer_a`, `firm:reference_property_a`, `firm:reference_utility_a` |
| Banks                  | 2     | `bank:reference_bank_a`, `bank:reference_bank_b`                                                                    |
| Investor types         | 3     | `investor:reference_pension_a`, `investor:reference_passive_a`, `investor:reference_macro_a`                        |
| Exchange (1 market)    | 1     | `market:reference_equity_market`                                                                                    |
| Real-estate market     | 1     | `market:reference_real_estate_central`                                                                              |
| Information source     | 1     | `source:reference_news_outlet`                                                                                      |
| Policy authority       | 1     | `authority:reference_central_bank` (also exposed as institution `institution:reference_central_bank`)               |
| External factors       | 2     | `factor:reference_macro_index`, `factor:reference_fx_pair`                                                          |

All eight v0 spaces (Corporate, Banking, Investors, Exchange, Real
Estate, Information, Policy, External) are registered. Banking and
Investors are the event-bus delivery targets in step 7. The other
six are populated to demonstrate that the demo world is genuinely
multi-space — not just a runner with two stub spaces.

The `examples/reference_world/entities.yaml` file is the canonical
entity catalog; the runnable `run_reference_loop.py` consumes it.

## How to run the demo

From the `japan-financial-world/` directory:

```bash
python examples/reference_world/run_reference_loop.py
```

The script:

1. Builds a `WorldKernel` and registers all eight spaces.
2. Loads the entity catalog from
   `examples/reference_world/entities.yaml`.
3. Seeds one external process (`process:reference_macro_index`)
   and one priced subject (`firm:reference_manufacturer_a`) so the
   reference loop has the inputs it needs.
4. Walks the seven-step `ReferenceLoopRunner` chain.
5. Advances the clock by two days so the next-tick `WorldEvent`
   delivery completes.
6. Prints a summary: ledger record count, breakdown by event type,
   the seven causal-chain record IDs, and which target spaces
   received the event delivery.

The script returns the populated kernel for further interactive
inspection if imported as a module.

## Ledger records to inspect

After a demo run, the ledger contains (at minimum) these event
types — in this order:

| Step | Ledger event type            | Source / cause                                            |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| —    | `object_registered` (×N)     | Registry registrations for every entity in `entities.yaml` |
| —    | `*_state_added` (×N)         | One per identity-level state record in each space         |
| —    | `external_process_added`     | Macro process spec                                        |
| —    | `price_updated`              | Seed price for the valued firm                            |
| —    | `institution_profile_added`  | Central-bank institution profile                          |
| 1    | `external_observation_added` | Step 1 — observe macro index                              |
| 2    | `signal_added`               | Step 2 — signal references observation                    |
| 3    | `valuation_added`            | Step 3 — valuation references signal                      |
| 4    | `valuation_compared`         | Step 4 — comparator emits gap; parent = step-3 record id  |
| 5    | `institution_action_recorded`| Step 5 — action; parents = step-3 + step-4 record ids     |
| 6    | `signal_added`               | Step 6 — follow-up signal references action               |
| 7    | `event_published`            | Step 7 — `WorldEvent` published                           |
| 7+1  | `event_delivered` (×2)       | After day-2 tick, banking + investors each receive one    |

The full chain is reconstructable from `record.parent_record_ids` and
domain `related_ids` / `input_refs` / `output_refs` fields. See
[`expected_story.md`](../examples/reference_world/expected_story.md)
for the per-record narrative.

## Why this is useful for future stress testing

v1 does **not** implement stress testing. The demo is not a stress
test. But v2+ stress-testing milestones will rely on the same
properties the demo exercises:

- **Deterministic causal graph.** A stress test that follows "shock
  → action → signal → consequence" needs every step to be a record,
  every record to be discoverable from the ledger, and every cross-
  reference to hold. The demo proves the v1 record set + orchestrator
  can do this end-to-end.
- **Append-only audit trail.** A stress test cannot rewrite history.
  The v0 / v1 ledger contract makes that impossible by construction.
- **No-mutation guarantee on unrelated books.** A stress chain that
  touches valuations and signals must not silently change ownership
  or contracts. The demo's ledger and snapshot diff show that the
  chain only writes where it claims to.
- **Cross-references as data, not validation.** A stress scenario
  may reference a hypothetical institution that has not yet been
  registered. v1's rule that resolution is the caller's job lets a
  v2+ stress run plug in scenarios incrementally without ordering
  constraints.

When a future v2 (or v1+ behavioral milestone) introduces real
stress-test logic, the *shape* of its chain — observation → signal →
valuation → action → consequence — is what the demo validates today.
The demo's job is to make sure that shape is concrete, runnable, and
inspectable before any specific stress logic is layered on top.

## Why the demo uses fictional entities

Three reasons:

1. **Public-release hygiene.** Per
   [`public_private_boundary.md`](public_private_boundary.md), the
   public repo must not contain real-institution names tied to
   simulation outcomes. A demo named after real banks, firms, or
   policy authorities would cross that line; a demo named with
   `*_reference_*` synthetic ids cannot.
2. **No calibration implied.** Real names imply calibrated
   parameters. The demo's parameters (the macro index base value,
   the seed price, the valuation, the gap) are illustrative round
   numbers chosen for traceability, not realism. Synthetic ids make
   the lack of calibration explicit.
3. **Reusable across jurisdictions.** v2 (Japan public) and v3
   (Japan proprietary) will *populate* the same record shapes with
   real data; v1's demo provides the structural template. A
   jurisdiction-neutral demo is the cleanest hand-off, because
   nothing in the demo presumes any specific market.

## Boundary with other parts of the repo

The reference demo is **layered on top of** the existing v0 + v1
code; it adds **no new behavior**. Specifically, the demo:

- imports only `WorldKernel`, the eight space classes, the v1 books
  (`ValuationBook`, `InstitutionBook`, `ExternalProcessBook`,
  `RelationshipCapitalBook`), and `ReferenceLoopRunner`;
- never extends, subclasses, or monkey-patches any of those;
- writes only through the public APIs already used by the v1.6
  closing test (`tests/test_reference_loop.py`);
- contains no decision logic, no reaction function, no matching
  engine, and no scenario branching.

If a future request would require any of the above, that request is
a v1+ behavioral milestone, not an extension of this demo.

## Files in this milestone

- `docs/fwe_reference_demo_design.md` — this document.
- `examples/reference_world/README.md` — short entry-point.
- `examples/reference_world/entities.yaml` — entity catalog.
- `examples/reference_world/expected_story.md` — per-step narrative
  of the ledger trace.
- `examples/reference_world/run_reference_loop.py` — runnable
  script using only existing v0 / v1 APIs.
- `tests/test_reference_demo.py` — verifies the script runs and
  produces the expected ledger event types.

No file under `world/`, `spaces/`, or any existing test file is
modified. The 632 / 632 v0 + v1 test count grows by the number of
new demo tests; no existing test is changed.
