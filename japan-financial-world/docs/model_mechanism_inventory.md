## Mechanism taxonomy

A *mechanism* is a piece of code that takes typed inputs and
produces typed outputs in a way that can be audited from the
ledger. Below is the taxonomy used in this inventory, ordered
roughly from "least model-substance" to "most":

| Class | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **infrastructure** | The kernel surface that lets other things compose. No domain content of its own. Examples: `Registry`, `EventBus`, `Clock`. |
| **source-of-truth storage** | An append-only / immutable book that records typed records. No behavior beyond CRUD + invariants. Examples: `OwnershipBook`, `ContractBook`, `SignalBook`. |
| **structural model** | Records typed *relationships* (who owns whom, who is exposed to which variable). Still data; no dynamics. Examples: `RelationshipCapitalBook`, `ExposureBook`. |
| **observation / attention model** | Records *who notices what* and *who selects what to consume*. Encodes heterogeneity but does not interpret it economically. Examples: `AttentionBook`, `ObservationMenuBuilder`. |
| **routine / process model** | Encodes *who does what action when*, recording the run as data. The action itself may be synthetic. Examples: `RoutineEngine`, `corporate_quarterly_reporting`. |
| **deterministic demo rule** | A small, hand-coded rule that takes inputs and produces a recordable output. Synthetic; never calibrated. Examples: the v1.8.12 selection rule (`select_observations_for_profile`); the v1.8.13 review payload. |
| **economic behavior model** | A mechanism that produces an output meant to *carry economic interpretation* — a margin estimate, a valuation claim, a credit pressure score, a price update. **None currently implemented.** |
| **not yet modeled** | A capability the project intentionally does not provide. Examples: trading, lending decisions, price formation, macro dynamics. |

The taxonomy is deliberately ordered so the line *"this project
does not yet ship economic behavior models"* is unambiguous. The
**deterministic demo rule** class is the closest the current
tree gets — it produces structured outputs from structured
inputs, but the outputs are recordable artifacts, not economic
claims.

## Component classification

Every component below is currently in the tree at v1.9.2.
"Future model attachment point" names where a future v1.9.x or
v1.x economic-behavior model could plug in **as a mechanism**
(see `world/mechanisms.py` — `MechanismAdapter` Protocol).

### Kernel infrastructure

| Component | Class | What it does | What it does NOT do | Mutates economic state? | Decisions? | Deterministic? | Calibrated? | Synthetic-only? | Future model attachment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WorldKernel` | infrastructure | Wires every book + clock + scheduler + ledger + state into one object. | Run any economic step. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | Hosts future mechanism adapters. |

| `State` | infrastructure | Minimal mutable state facade. | Encode any domain meaning. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | — |

### Source-of-truth storage books

| Component | Class | What it does | What it does NOT do | Mutates state? | Decisions? | Det? | Cal? | Synth? | Future attachment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OwnershipBook` | source-of-truth storage | `add_position`, `transfer`, balance reads. | Decide who owns what. | No (it *records* mutations the caller drove). | No | Yes | No | Yes | Investor-intent and credit mechanisms emit ownership-change proposals. |
| `ContractBook` | source-of-truth storage | Record + status-update contracts; covenants stored as data. | Trip covenants automatically. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | Credit-review mechanism reads covenants; constraint-response mechanism proposes status updates. |
| `PriceBook` | source-of-truth storage | Append-only price observations. | Form prices. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | A future market mechanism (FCN / herding / MG / SG / LOB adapter) would write here through proposed records the caller commits. |

| `ConstraintEvaluator` | deterministic demo rule | Caller-initiated evaluation of one constraint against current state. | Stress-test scenarios. | No | The evaluator returns pass / fail; no behavior follows from it in v1.x. | Yes | No | Yes | Caller-side mechanism that produces constraint-evaluation records. |
| `SignalBook` | source-of-truth storage | Records `InformationSignal`s with visibility / credibility metadata. | Emit signals. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | Every routine and every mechanism that produces a signal writes here. |

| `InstitutionBook` | source-of-truth storage | `InstitutionProfile`, `MandateRecord`, `PolicyInstrumentProfile`, `InstitutionalActionRecord` (v1.3 four-property action contract). | Decide policy. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | A future policy-reaction mechanism would emit `InstitutionalActionRecord`s through the contract. Out of scope for v1.x. |
| `RelationshipCapitalBook` | structural model | Directed-pair relationship records with strength. | Decay strength autonomously. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | Relationship-mediated mechanisms (e.g., who tells whom) read here. |
| `ExternalProcessBook` | source-of-truth storage | Stores external-factor process specs + observations + scenario paths. | Run them. | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | A future macro mechanism would step a process and emit observations. v1.x stores only. |

### v1.8 endogenous activity layer

## Verdict

> **The current system is an auditable routine-driven
> information-flow substrate. It is not yet a price-formation
> model, credit model, valuation model, macro model, or
> firm-financial dynamics model.**

What the system *does* do, well:

- record who notices what and what they selected;
- record routine runs that consume selections and emit
  audit-only review notes;
- preserve every record in a deterministic, replay-checked
  ledger;
- render the result as a Markdown / JSON report that a
  reader can verify in 60 seconds.

What it does **not** do — and the gap audit
([`behavioral_gap_audit.md`](behavioral_gap_audit.md)) names the
ranking — is *interpret* any of those records as economic
claims. There is no margin number that came from a balance-sheet
update mechanism, no valuation that came from a discount-rate
mechanism, no credit pressure that came from a covenant-stress
mechanism, no price that came from a market mechanism. Those are
the targets for v1.9.4 onward.

## Mechanism interface (from `world/mechanisms.py`)

The substrate now ships a small mechanism interface so v1.9.4+
mechanisms have a standard shape to attach. The interface is
**pure data** — the dataclasses carry no behavior. Mechanisms
*propose* outputs; the caller decides what is committed.

### Five types

```python
MechanismSpec        — model_id, model_family, version,
                       assumptions, calibration_status,
                       stochasticity, required_inputs,
                       output_types, metadata
MechanismInputBundle — structured inputs (selected_refs, state
                       views, variable observations, exposures,
                       caller-supplied parameters)
MechanismOutputBundle — proposed records the caller may commit
                        (signals, valuations, run records,
                        constraint pressure deltas, etc.)
MechanismRunRecord   — append-only audit record of one
                       mechanism invocation (model_id, status,
                       input / output digests, ledger refs)
MechanismAdapter     — Protocol for "an object with a `spec`
                       and `apply(input) -> output`" — adapters
                       are how concrete mechanisms (FCN /
                       herding / MG / SG / LOB / firm-financial /
                       valuation / credit-review) plug in
```

### Mechanism principles

1. **Mechanisms do not directly mutate books.** They propose
   outputs; the caller commits them through the existing
   `add_*` ledger paths.
2. **Mechanisms consume typed refs / selected observations /
   state views.** Inputs are explicit; no hidden globals.
3. **Mechanisms return proposed records or output bundles.**
4. **The caller decides which outputs are committed.**
5. **Every mechanism run is ledger-auditable.**
6. **Each mechanism declares**: `model_id`, `model_family`,
   `version`, `assumptions`, `calibration_status`,
   `stochasticity`, `required_inputs`, `output_types`.
7. **Reference mechanisms are simple and synthetic.** v1.9.4 –
   v1.9.6 mechanisms must be jurisdiction-neutral, deterministic
   (or pinned-seed stochastic), and produce visible ledger
   traces.
8. **Advanced mechanisms (FCN, herding, minority game,
   speculation game, LOB models) attach as adapters.** They are
   v2+ candidates; v1.x ships the *contract* they will fit
   into.

### Suggested mechanism families

The five families v1.9.4+ will populate:

- `firm_financial_mechanism` — synthetic margin / liquidity /
  debt pressure update from corporate-reporting signals + world
  variables.
- `valuation_mechanism` — selected refs → `ValuationRecord`
  proposals + `ValuationGap`.
- `credit_review_mechanism` — selected refs → credit-review
  notes + constraint-pressure deltas.
- `investor_intent_mechanism` — selected refs → non-binding
  intent records (no trades, no orders, no allocations).
- `market_mechanism` — FCN / herding / MG / SG / LOB adapters.
  Out of scope for v1.x.

The first four are the recommended next milestones; the last is
explicitly v2+ territory.
