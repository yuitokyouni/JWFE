## Why this exists

Through v1.9.0 → v1.9.7 the living reference world grew from a
single-period chain demo (corporate report → menu → selection
→ review) to a four-period sweep that also runs three
synthetic mechanisms each period: firm operating pressure
assessment (v1.9.4), valuation refresh lite (v1.9.5), and bank
credit review lite (v1.9.7). Each mechanism is integrated into
the per-period sweep through bounded all-pairs traversal:

- valuation refresh runs once per `(investor, firm)` pair,
- bank credit review runs once per `(bank, firm)` pair.

The fixture is **deliberately tiny** — 3 firms, 2 investors,
2 banks, 4 periods — and these bounded products are explicitly
demo-bounded. They are fine *only* because the fixture is fixed
and synthetic. The same loop shape against a production-scale
agent population would scale super-linearly in actor count,
which is exactly what this milestone forbids without a sparse
gating layer.

This milestone records the loop shapes so that:

1. Future increases in fixture size cannot accidentally trip a
   quadratic explosion without a test failing first.
2. Future production-like traversal *must* gate on
   relationships / exposures / coverage — not on Cartesian
   actor-product loops.
3. Anyone reviewing the v1.9 freeze surface can see, in one
   place, what the engine is and is not doing.

## Current loop shapes (v1.12.1)

The following table describes the loop shape of each phase
inside `world/reference_living_world.run_living_reference_world`.
`P` = number of periods, `F` = number of firms, `I` = number
of investors, `B` = number of banks, `N` = number of unique
industries derived from the firm → industry map, `M` = number of
synthetic markets in the orchestrator's market-condition spec
set, `K` = capital-market readouts per period (always 1 in
v1.11.1+). The `n_obs` and `n_exposures` factors are bounded by
the fixture's variable count (currently 4) and per-firm exposure
count (currently 2–3 each).

+ ~14 one-off setup (interactions, routines, profiles)
+   4 one-off setup (stewardship themes, v1.10.5)

```

Of the loops above:

- The **bounded all-pairs** loops are the valuation
  `O(P × I × F)`, the bank credit review `O(P × B × F)`, the
  portfolio-company dialogue `O(P × I × F)`, and the investor
  escalation candidate `O(P × I × F)`. These four are the only
  bounded all-pairs traversals; v1.10.5 deliberately did **not**
  add a new dense shape (it reuses the existing `I × F` shape
  for both engagement records).
- All other loops are linear in the actor, firm, or industry
  count.

## v1.9 demo discipline

For v1.9.x and v1.9.last:

1. **All-pairs traversal is allowed inside fixed demo-size
   fixtures only.** The demo is not allowed to grow `F`, `I`,
   or `B` beyond a small constant without a milestone that
   first introduces sparse gating.
2. **No path enumeration.** No mechanism may iterate over
   reachable paths in any graph (interactions, ownership,
   relationships, exposures). Path-shaped views remain
   diagnostic, not operational.
3. **No hidden quadratic loops.** The record-count test in
   `tests/test_living_reference_world_performance_boundary.py`
   pins both the per-period and the total record count to
   exact expected values plus a small infrastructure
   allowance. Any change that adds a `(actor × actor)` or
   `(actor × event × firm)` loop will fail it.
4. **Tensor / matrix views are diagnostic.** The interaction
   tensor (`S × S × C`) and the matrix views constructed in
   v1.8 are *not* execution traversal plans. They are not
   materialised on the per-period sweep path.
5. **Reporting cost is `O(R)`.** Living-world report,
   replay-canonicalisation, and manifest are linear scans
   over the ledger record list. They must remain so.

## Sparse gating principles (future)

When v2.x or later begins adding sparse traversal to lift the
demo-bounded ceiling, the following gating principles apply.
None of these are implemented in v1.9.x; they are pinned here
so that a future contributor cannot quietly skip them.

- **Bank credit review** must be gated by an explicit set of
  *(bank, firm)* relationships — for example, `ContractBook`
  exposures (loans, guarantees, derivatives), held positions,
  watchlists, sector mandates, or credit-monitoring
  relationships. The dense `B × F` form is for the synthetic
  demo only.
- **Investor valuation** must be gated by holdings, coverage
  universes, mandates, or watchlists. The dense `I × F` form
  is for the synthetic demo only.
- **Menus** must be built from actor-specific exposure /
  relationship / visibility indexes. They must not enumerate
  every observation in the world.
- **Interaction tensor and matrix views** are diagnostic
  views, not traversal plans. A traversal plan that consults
  them is reading a view, not enumerating paths.
- **No path enumeration in v1.9.** When path-aware reasoning
  becomes necessary, it must be either hop-bounded or
  index-bounded.

## Future acceleration (deferred)

Python remains adequate for v1.9.x. The bounded sweep
completes in well under one second on the default fixture,
and the suite of 1623 tests runs in under ten seconds.

Candidate hot paths *if* future scaling demands a native
component:

- large-scale exposure joins (`ExposureBook` cross-products),
- large menu construction over big visibility indexes,
- a market mechanism / limit order book simulation,
- dense tensor / matrix views if ever materialised on the
  per-period path,
- repeated valuation / credit-review mechanism sweeps over
  large agent populations.

**The first step toward scale is profiling and sparse
indexing, not a premature native rewrite.** No C++, no Julia,
no Rust, no GPU work is in scope for v1.9.x or v1.9.last.

## Semantic caveat — review is not origination

A frequent misreading of v1.9.7 is that "all-bank × all-firm
credit review" describes a real lending-decision flow. It does
not. v1.9.7 produces *review notes* — diagnostic signals about
what a bank looked at and how the evidence aggregated as a
pressure score. v1.9.7 does not:

- approve, reject, or originate any loan,
- enforce any covenant,
- mutate `ContractBook` or `ConstraintBook`,
- declare default, or
- imply a probability of default or an internal rating.

A realistic origination workflow — *firm funding request →
bank underwriting → proposed terms → contract mutation* —
is **future work**, not v1.9.x. The current dense `B × F`
loop is demo-bounded monitoring, used because the synthetic
demo wants every bank to record one note about every firm
each period for explainability. A real engine would gate the
loop on the actual `(bank, firm)` lending relationships.

## Test pins

The discipline above is enforced by
`tests/test_living_reference_world_performance_boundary.py`.
**Note on units:** the budget pinned below is a *per-run total*
(across all four periods), not a per-period count. At v1.12.1
the per-period count is 70 records (37 v1.9.x + 18 v1.10.5
+ 5 v1.11.0 capital-market + 1 v1.11.1 capital-market readout
+ 3 v1.12.0 firm financial latent state + 6 v1.12.1 investor
intent); the per-run total is `70 × 4 = 280`, plus an
infrastructure allowance for one-off setup records (14 v1.9.x
infra + 4 v1.10.5 stewardship themes + headroom; v1.11.0 /
v1.11.1 / v1.11.2 / v1.12.0 / v1.12.1 add no new setup records).

- per-period record formula equals
  `2F + F + N + M + K + F + 2(I+B) + IF + BF + IF + IF + IF + F + 2(I+B) = 70`
  for the default fixture (with `N = 3` industries,
  `M = 5` markets, `K = 1` capital-market readout per period,
  one v1.12.0 firm-state record per firm per period, and one
  v1.12.1 investor-intent record per (investor, firm) pair per
  period),
- per-run total record count for a default 4-period sweep sits
  in `[280, 312]` — i.e. exactly `formula × periods` at the
  lower edge plus up to a 32-record infrastructure allowance,
- the valuation count for the run equals exactly `P × I × F`,
- the bank credit review count for the run equals exactly
  `P × B × F`,
- the firm pressure signal count for the run equals exactly
  `P × F`,
- the industry demand condition count for the run equals
  exactly `P × N`,
- the capital-market condition count for the run equals
  exactly `P × M` (v1.11.0),
- the capital-market readout count for the run equals exactly
  `P × K` (v1.11.1; default `K = 1`),
- the firm financial latent state count for the run equals
  exactly `P × F` (v1.12.0),
- the investor intent signal count for the run equals exactly
  `P × I × F` (v1.12.1),
- the dialogue count for the run equals exactly `P × I × F`,
- the investor escalation candidate count for the run equals
  exactly `P × I × F`,
- the corporate strategic response candidate count for the run
  equals exactly `P × F`,
- the stewardship theme count for the run equals exactly
  `I × T` where `T` is the number of theme types (default 2),
- no order, price-update, contract-mutation, ownership-
  transfer, covenant-breach, institution-action-recorded, or
  firm-state-added records appear in the ledger,
- no v1.10 ledger payload carries a forecast / revenue /
  market-size / vote_cast / proposal_filed / campaign_executed /
  exit_executed / letter_sent / buyback_executed /
  dividend_changed / divestment_executed / merger_executed /
  board_change_executed / disclosure_filed / transcript /
  content / notes / minutes / attendees key,
- no warnings or errors appear in the ledger on the default
  sweep.

If any of those pins fails, the demo has either grown the
fixture (intentional but undocumented) or gained a hidden
quadratic loop (unintended).
